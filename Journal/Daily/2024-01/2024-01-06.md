## A note on how I create Meeting Notes
![[Pasted image 20240106114639.png]]
- As you can see in the Source View screenshot I don't pay much attention to note names. I use a 3rd party app called [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) to automatically create these names for me which are always unique. 
- Clicking on a link creates the note in the folder path you see. 
- The reason I don't bother with note names is because for me the content of the notes is what is important. I attribute each meeting note with properties so that I can query the notes for use later. 

# Journal
---
- General thoughts on the day. I sometimes reflect on the staff I manage and tab the comment with the person Notice I am not using a TAG - I treat People and Projects as "objects" - which to me means they have a page that summarizes them. [[Bob Smith]]
