# Creation
---
- This is a meeting note. It is created from a link from the Daily Note

# Usage
---
- I use meeting notes to capture the notes, but also the topic, the people, the project. My notes are DATA. If you go to the note for Bob Smith you will see this note listed in the query, along with the topic. This is a good way for me to prepare for a review with Bob later in the year by quickly seeing all of the meetings we had and reviewing them. 
- The INTO section below is where I put any meeting prep I need to do. 
- You will notice no task area. I use a 3rd Party app called TickTick for tasks as it is good for what it does - TASKS on multiple platforms. I embed TickTick into Obsidian using the Custom Frames plugin - showing this is beyond the scope of this exercise.
